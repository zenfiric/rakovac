My journey into the fascinating world of dentistry begins in my homeland: Serbia.  
In 2013, I graduated as a general dentist and worked there with great joy and passion.  
I moved to the Netherlands in 2016 for love.  

In 2018, I successfully completed my evaluation process at the Academic Center for Dentistry Amsterdam.  
This step enabled me to work independently as a General Dentist in the Netherlands.  

During my work in my homeland and in the Netherlands, I noticed an increase in the number of patients with oral problems.  
It is becoming more common for people to attend check-ups irregularly.  

There are also many miscommunications between patients and practitioners. These issues often arise due to busy schedules and work life increasingly taking precedence in daily life.  

As a result, people donâ€™t always feel at ease with the dentist.  

> "A quarter of the Dutch population is afraid of the dentist. Around 800,000 people are so afraid that they no longer dare to go (dental phobia). This significantly increases the risk of long-term problems with teeth, molars, and gums."

Fortunately, something can be done about it.
